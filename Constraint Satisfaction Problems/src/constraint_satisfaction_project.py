# CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS (15 points total)
# =============================================================================

"""
CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS - Answer these questions in your code comments:

Q1 (5 points): What is the time complexity of backtrack search in the worst case?
Answer: The time complexity of backtrack search in the worst case is O(d^n) where d is the 
maximum domain size and n is the number of variables. This occurs when we need to explore 
the entire search space.

Q2 (5 points): How does constraint propagation improve the efficiency of CSP solving?
Answer: Constraint propagation improves efficiency by reducing the search space early in the 
process. It eliminates values that cannot be part of any solution, reducing the number of 
backtracks needed and pruning branches of the search tree.

Q3 (5 points): What is the relationship between constraint tightness and problem difficulty?
Answer: Constraint tightness affects problem difficulty in a non-linear way. Very loose 
constraints make problems easy (many solutions), very tight constraints also make problems 
easy (no solutions), but moderate tightness creates the hardest problems (few solutions, 
requiring extensive search).

BONUS QUESTIONS (10 points total):

B1 (5 points): Explain the phase transition phenomenon in random CSPs.
Answer: The phase transition phenomenon refers to the sharp change in satisfiability 
probability as constraint tightness increases. There's a critical point where problems 
transition from being almost always satisfiable to almost always unsatisfiable.

B2 (5 points): How do heuristics like MRV and LCV improve backtrack search performance?
Answer: MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) reduces the branching factor by choosing variables 
with fewer remaining values first. LCV (Least Constraining Value) reduces the probability 
of backtracking by choosing values that leave more options for other variables.
