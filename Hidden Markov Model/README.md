### 🧪 Preprocessing for HMM

To apply Hidden Markov Models, we converted raw numerical data into discrete **weather states**:

**Weather Discretization Rules**:
- **Rainy**: Precipitation > 0.01 inches 🌧️
- **Snowy**: Snowfall > 0.1 inches ❄️
- **Sunny**: Max temperature > 75°F and no precipitation ☀️
- **Cloudy**: Max temperature 40-75°F and no precipitation ☁️
- **Cold**: Max temperature ≤ 40°F 🥶

**Hidden States**:
- **Dry**: Sunny, Cloudy, Cold weather patterns 🌤️
- **Wet**: Rainy, Snowy weather patterns 🌧️❄️

This preprocessing allows the HMM to learn patterns in weather transitions and make predictions about future weather states.

## Understanding the Two Accuracy Metrics 📊

### 1. Category Accuracy (Dry/Wet) - Your Main Goal 🎯
**Definition**: Measures how well the model predicts the correct hidden state (Dry or Wet).

**Typical Value**: ~0.82 (82%) with a well-implemented HMM.

**Why This Matters**:
- This is the main target for a 2-state HMM, since the hidden states are what the model is designed to infer. If you achieve >0.75 category accuracy, you have implemented the HMM correctly and learned the core concept.

**What It Means**: Your HMM can successfully distinguish between dry weather patterns (Sunny, Cloudy, Cold) and wet weather patterns (Rainy, Snowy).

### 2. Weather Type Accuracy (Rainy/Snowy/Sunny/Cloudy/Cold) - Advanced Challenge 🚀
**Definition**: Measures how well the model predicts the exact observed weather type for each day.

**Typical Values**:
- Basic HMM (2 hidden states): 0.30–0.35 (30–35%)
- With advanced enhancements: up to ~0.62 (62%) using temperature/seasonal rules.

**Why This Is Harder**:
- This is a much harder task for a 2-state HMM, since the model is not designed to distinguish all 5 weather types perfectly. You need to implement methods to improve this accuracy.

**What It Means**: Your HMM can predict the specific weather type, not just whether it's dry or wet.

## How to Approach This Assignment 💡

**Your main goal is to build an HMM that can accurately infer the hidden weather state (Dry or Wet) from the observed data.**

**If your model achieves at least 75% accuracy in predicting Dry/Wet, you have done well!** ✅

**Predicting the exact weather type (Rainy, Snowy, etc.) is much harder with a 2-state HMM, but you should still try to improve this accuracy.**

**Think creatively about how to use all available information to improve weather type predictions.** 🧠

### Conceptual Guidance for Weather Type Prediction 💭

The assignment provides step-by-step guidance for implementing multiple prediction methods:

1. **Basic Weighted Probabilities**: Use hidden state probabilities and emission probabilities
2. **Smoothing**: Use forward-backward algorithm results for better predictions
3. **Enhanced Prediction**: Consider additional information beyond the basic HMM

**Conceptual Approaches for Achieving >0.5 Weather Type Accuracy:**
- Think about how to use smoothed probabilities instead of filtered probabilities
- Consider what additional information from the original weather data could help
- Explore patterns between weather types and hidden states
- Consider how temperature data might influence weather type predictions
- Think about seasonal patterns and weather transitions

**Note**: With a 2-state HMM (Dry/Wet), achieving weather type accuracy above 60% is challenging but demonstrates excellent understanding of HMM principles and creative prediction methods.
