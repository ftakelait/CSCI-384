# üéß Naive Bayes Spotify Classifier

**Programming Project Assignment: CSCI 384 AI**

This project applies **Naive Bayes classification** to a real-world dataset containing audio features of Spotify songs, with the goal of predicting whether a song is a **hit** based on its measurable characteristics.

This is a structured, step-by-step programming project designed to guide you through the complete process of implementing and evaluating a Naive Bayes classifier on real-world data. Each section in the script builds on the previous one‚Äîfrom loading and cleaning the dataset, to model training, prediction, and evaluation‚Äîallowing you to apply core AI concepts in a hands-on and practical way.

## üìö What You'll Practice

- Naive Bayes classification using Gaussian (continuous) probability
- Transforming a continuous target (popularity) into a binary classification problem
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (numeric feature selection, handling missing values)
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Model evaluation using classification accuracy and confusion matrix
- (Optional) Model experimentation with dynamic threshold tuning

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset is a preprocessed snapshot of Spotify songs with various audio features.

### Dataset Information

- Number of songs: 510
- Number of features: 12
- Target column (original): popularity (continuous)

### Feature Columns

```python
['genre', 'artist_name', 'acousticness', 'danceability', 'duration_ms',
 'energy', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'loudness', 'speechiness',
 'tempo', 'valence']
```

### Missing Values (before cleaning)

| Feature      | Missing |
| ------------ | ------- |
| acousticness | 1       |
| danceability | 4       |
| liveness     | 1       |
| speechiness  | 2       |
| valence      | 2       |

### Original Target (`popularity`) Unique Values

`[0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ..., 93]`

## ‚úÖ How to Submit

Submit your completed `naive_bayes_project.py` file following these guidelines:

- ‚úÖ **Filename format:**  
  Your Python script must be named according to the three project members‚Äô last names in the format: `NBC-A_B_C.py`
  where:

- **NBC** stands for _Naive Bayes Classifier_
- **A**, **B**, **C** are the last names of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd group members

Example: `NBC-Smith_Jones_Kim.py`

- ‚úÖ **What to submit:**

1. Your final `.py` file should:

   - Run without errors
   - Include your answers and explanations (as comments or variables)
   - (Optional) Complete the bonus section for extra credit

2. **A written PDF report** (`NBCReport-Smith_Jones_Kim.pdf`) that contains only your outputs and your written discussion.

- Do not include full code in the report‚Äîonly outputs.
- Use the three defined colors to highlight each member‚Äôs name in the title and contributions.

- ‚úÖ **Where to submit:**  
  Upload your renamed `.py` file to the course submission portal (e.g., Blackboard).

---

üìå **Reminder:** Only submit your `.py` file and `.docx` file together zipped as `NBC-Smith_Jones_Kim.zip` ‚Äî do not submit the data files, utility scripts, or the entire folder.
